This repository contains my implementations of the Firefly algorithm and V-Detector negative selection algorithm.

The witness files provide results that were achieved within 60 seconds for the Firefly algorithm on real valued functions and k-GCP.

Thanks to my Iain Stewert for providing amazing skeleton and validation code for this project.
